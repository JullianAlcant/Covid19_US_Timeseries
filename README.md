📊 U.S. COVID-19 Confirmed Cases Forecasting Project

Author: Jullian Alcantara
Tools Used: R, fpp3, COVID19, ARIMA, STL Decomposition, ggplot2

📌 Project Overview
This project forecasts daily confirmed COVID-19 cases in the United States using time series modeling. The goal was to identify short-term trends and assess how far into the future forecasts remain reliable for potential public health decision-making.

🎯 Objective
Analyze trends, seasonality, and irregularities in daily COVID-19 cases
Build and compare statistical forecasting models (ARIMA)
Forecast future confirmed cases and evaluate prediction accuracy over time

📈 Data Source
📦 COVID-19 Data Hub (Guidotti & Ardia, 2020)
Daily U.S. confirmed case counts from January 21, 2020 to early 2024

⚙️ Methodology
Data Cleaning & Transformation
Converted to time series object
Applied square root transformation to stabilize variance
Trend & Seasonality Analysis
Used STL decomposition to visualize trend, yearly, and weekly patterns
Stationarity Testing
Performed KPSS tests and applied first/second differencing to achieve stationarity
Model Selection
Compared ARIMA(3,1,0)(0,1,1) and ARIMA(3,1,0)(1,1,0) based on AICc
Selected ARIMA(3,1,0)(1,1,0) as best model
Residual Diagnostics
Checked for white noise residuals through ACF/PACF, histograms, and residual plots
Forecasting
Generated a 25-week forecast of daily confirmed cases
Evaluated confidence intervals and practical forecast horizon

📊 Key Findings
Strong seasonality and multiple waves observed through STL decomposition
ARIMA(3,1,0)(1,1,0) model demonstrated the best fit and reliable residual diagnostics
Forecasts are actionable for 4–8 weeks ahead; intervals widen significantly after this

📑 Project Deliverables
📜 Clean, reproducible R script with annotated code
📊 Forecast visualizations with prediction intervals
📋 Model selection metrics and diagnostic summaries

📌 Sample Forecast Plot
Forecast of daily U.S. confirmed COVID-19 cases, with 80% and 95% confidence intervals.

📚 Learnings
Practical experience with time series forecasting using R
Importance of model diagnostics and transformation in volatile data
Real-world application of statistical models for decision support
